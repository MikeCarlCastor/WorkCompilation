--INSIGHT--
--76% of the total revenue lost
--due to disputes is from the country France.
--Since the company believes that the
--quality of the services is not the main reason
--for the disputes, the company should work on their contract 
--technicalities and make not only strict liability for breach
--but also understandable and unambiguous.
--This way, the company can demand payment firmly so clients won't get away
--from not paying the services, especially for clients in France. 
--Furthermore, giving better discounts for those who pay early
--will encourage clients to make early payments.
